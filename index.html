    <div class="article-style">
      <!-- I am a fourth-year PhD Candidate in the [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/) at the [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Morley Mao](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~zmao/). I received my bachelor's degree from the [School of the Gifted Young](https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/) at the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), majoring in computer science and advised by [Prof. Wei Gong](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~weigong/).  -->
<p>I am a fourth-year PhD Candidate in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Michigan under the supervision of <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~zmao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Z. Morley Mao</a>. I received my bachelor&rsquo;s degree from the <a href="https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">School of the Gifted Young</a> at the University of Science and Technology of China, majoring in computer science and advised by <a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~weigong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Wei Gong</a>.</p>
<!-- My current research interests lie in creating systems to support machine learning model deployments (Systems for ML) and building intelligent and reliable network systems with machine learning models (ML for Systems). -->
<p>My interests span machine learning systems and mobile computing, with a current focus on optimizing large language model (LLM) inference efficiency from both algorithmic and systems perspectives.</p>
<p>I was a research intern at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Research Redmond</a>, in the summer of 2023, fortunately working with <a href="https://francisyyan.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Francis Y. Yan</a> on build safe machine learning systems. I also interned at <a href="https://damo.alibaba.com/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alibaba DAMO Academy</a>, in the summer of 2020, collaborating with Dr. Hong Wu and Dr. Tieying Zhang on applying machine learning to automatically tune database systems. I also work with <a href="https://vnpeng.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Nanyun Peng</a> as a research intern at the <a href="https://www.isi.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USC Information Sciences Institute</a> in 2019 summer to apply language models on extracting event hierarchy.</p>
<!-- During my PhD period, I work closely with [Prof. Feng Qian](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~fengqian/) from the University of Southern California and [Prof. Zhi-Li Zhang](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~zhang089/) from the University of Minnesota. -->

      <div class="article-style">
        Interstellar, directed by Christopher Nolan, is a critically acclaimed science fiction film released in 2014. Known for its ambitious storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and scientific accuracy, the film explores complex themes such as time, space, love, and survival. The plot of &ldquo;Interstellar&rdquo; is set in a dystopian future where Earth is becoming uninhabitable due to climate change and crop blights. The story follows a group of astronauts and scientists, led by former NASA pilot Cooper (played by Matthew McConaughey), who embark on a daring space mission through a wormhole near Saturn. Their goal is to find a new habitable planet for humanity, as Earth&rsquo;s resources are rapidly dwindling. The narrative delves into the realm of theoretical physics, particularly the concepts of wormholes, black holes, and relativity. The film is renowned for its scientific realism, with theoretical physicist Kip Thorne consulting on the script to ensure the accurate portrayal of these phenomena. &ldquo;Interstellar&rdquo; uniquely visualizes the effects of time dilation, where time passes at different rates for different characters, a concept rooted in Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity.

        Neon Genesis Evangelion, commonly known as &ldquo;EVA,&rdquo; is a groundbreaking Japanese anime television series directed by Hideaki Anno and produced by Gainax. First aired in 1995, the series has since become a cornerstone of the mecha genre in anime and a cultural phenomenon in its own right. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, &ldquo;Neon Genesis Evangelion&rdquo; takes place in a future Tokyo, fifteen years after a global cataclysm. The story revolves around Shinji Ikari, a teenager who is recruited by his estranged father to the secretive organization NERV to pilot a giant bio-mechanical robot known as an Evangelion. These robots are humanity&rsquo;s last defense against mysterious and powerful beings known as Angels. The series is notable for its deep psychological exploration of its characters, particularly focusing on Shinji&rsquo;s struggles with his sense of self, his relationships with others, and his unwillingness to pilot the Evangelion. The narrative intertwines complex themes such as identity, depression, and the nature of humanity with religious and philosophical symbolism, setting it apart from typical mecha action anime.

      <div class="article-style">
        Dead Poets Society, a 1989 American drama film directed by Peter Weir, is renowned for its inspirational story and powerful performances. The film is set in 1959 at the fictional elite conservative Welton Academy in Vermont and tells the story of an English teacher, John Keating, played by Robin Williams, who inspires his students through his teaching of poetry. The film is celebrated for its exploration of themes such as the stifling nature of conformity, the value of individuality, and the transformative power of literature and poetry. Keating&rsquo;s unconventional teaching methods and his mantra of &ldquo;Carpe Diem&rdquo; (Latin for &ldquo;Seize the Day&rdquo;) encourage his students to think for themselves and pursue their passions in life, challenging the rigid norms of their conservative schooling. The story focuses on several students, including Neil Perry, Todd Anderson, and others, who are deeply influenced by Keating. They resurrect a secret club called the &ldquo;Dead Poets Society,&rdquo; where they gather to read poetry, embracing the beauty and the freedom of expression it offers. The film beautifully captures the students&rsquo; journey of self-discovery, camaraderie, and the struggles they face in balancing their own desires with the expectations imposed upon them.

        Daniel Keyes, an American author, is best known for his deeply moving and intellectually stimulating novel &ldquo;Flowers for Algernon&rdquo; (献给阿尔吉侬的花束). First published as a short story in 1959 and later expanded into a full-length novel in 1966, &ldquo;Flowers for Algernon&rdquo; has become a classic in modern literature, celebrated for its sensitive treatment of complex themes. &ldquo;Flowers for Algernon&rdquo; tells the story of Charlie Gordon, a man with an IQ of 68, who undergoes an experimental surgical procedure to increase his intelligence. This procedure has previously been tested only on a lab mouse named Algernon. As Charlie&rsquo;s intelligence increases, he becomes aware of the social and emotional complexities of life that he had been oblivious to before. The novel is structured through progress reports written by Charlie, which initially show his limited cognitive abilities and then his rapid intellectual growth.

        Fountainhead a novel by Ayn Rand, stands as a monumental work in the world of literature, particularly known for its exploration of individualism and Rand&rsquo;s philosophy of Objectivism. Ayn Rand, a Russian-American writer and philosopher, gained widespread recognition and acclaim through her novels and philosophical writings, which advocate for rational individualism and laissez-faire capitalism. &ldquo;The Fountainhead,&rdquo; published in 1943, is one of Rand&rsquo;s most famous works. The novel centers around Howard Roark, an innovative and uncompromising young architect who refuses to conform to traditional architectural norms and societal expectations. Roark&rsquo;s character and his struggles represent Rand&rsquo;s ideal of the independent and creative individual who prioritizes personal vision and integrity over social conformity. The novel is set against the backdrop of the architecture industry, where Roark&rsquo;s modernist approach clashes with the prevailing styles. His battle against the establishment and his determination to pursue his artistic vision at all costs form the core of the story. The other characters in the novel, including Peter Keating, Ellsworth Toohey, and Dominique Francon, each represent different aspects of society and ideologies that contrast with Roark&rsquo;s Objectivist philosophy.
