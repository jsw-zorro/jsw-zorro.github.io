Prefix caching has emerged to save GPU power in this scenario, which saves KV cache at disks and reuse them across multiple queries. However, traditional prefix caching mechanisms often suffer from substantial latency because the speed of loading KV cache from disks to GPU memory is bottlenecked by the throughput of I/O devices. To optimize the latency of long-context prefill, we propose Cake, a novel KV cache loader, which employs a bidirectional parallelized KV cache generation strategy. Upon receiving a prefill task, Cake simultaneously and dynamically loads saved KV cache from prefix cache locations and computes KV cache on local GPUs, maximizing the utilization of available computation and I/O bandwidth resources. Additionally, Cake automatically adapts to diverse system statuses without manual parameter. tuning. In experiments on various prompt datasets, GPUs, and I/O devices, Cake offers up to 68.1% Time To First Token (TTFT) reduction compare with compute-only method and 94.6% TTFT reduction compare with I/O-only method.","tags":["LLM"],"title":"Compute Or Load KV Cache?

We present Eagle, a novel LLM routing approach that combines global and local ELO ranking modules to overcome these limitations.

Our experiments across multiple datasets show Eagle consistently outperforms baseline methods, with improvements of up to 23.52 percent in Area Under Curve (AUC) scores.

In this paper, we introduce AutoSpec, the first framework to automatically generate comprehensive and accurate specifications for neural networks in learning-augmented systems.

Recent approaches propose parallel decoding strategies, such as Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT), to improve performance by breaking prompts down into sub-problems that can be decoded in parallel; however, they often suffer from reduced response quality. Our key insight is that we can request additional information, specifically dependencies and difficulty, when generating the sub-problems to improve both response quality and performance. In this paper, we propose Skeleton Graph Decoding (SGD), which uses dependencies exposed between sub-problems to support information forwarding between dependent sub-problems for improved quality while exposing parallelization opportunities for decoding independent sub-problems. Additionally, we leverage difficulty estimates for each sub-problem to select an appropriately-sized model, improving performance without significantly reducing quality. Compared to standard autoregressive generation and SoT, SGD achieves a 1.69x speedup while improving quality by up to 51%.","tags":["LLM"],"title":"Adaptive Skeleton Graph Decoding","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shuowei Jin","Ruiyang Zhu","Ahmad Hassan","Xiao Zhu","Xumiao Zhang","Z.

However, such enhancements require intense computation power that is not affordable for a single mobile device, which hinders their real-world deployment. To address the limitation, we propose OASIS, the first system that facilitates multiple users in close proximity to execute intense neural-enhanced video streaming in real-time. To this end, OASIS intelligently distributes computation tasks among multiple mobile devices, selects appropriate video bitrates and super-resolution models, and optimizes video chunk delivery. As a result, the expensive neural-enhanced streaming is done through distributed collaboration, achieving optimal quality of experience (QoE). We implement and evaluate OASIS on commodity smartphones from different vendors, under various network and computation conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the high efficiency of OASIS: it improves the video streaming QoE by 40%-200% and reduces each participant's energy consumption by 60% when the system scales up from a single device to six devices.","tags":["Mobile system","Machine Learning System"],"title":"OASIS: Collaborative Neural-Enhanced Mobile Video Streaming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xumiao Zhang","Shuowei Jin","Yi He","Ahmad Hassan","Z.

However, security analysis and countermeasures for such threats are absent. To understand the impact of the vulnerability, we break the ground by proposing various real-time data fabrication attacks in which the attacker delivers crafted malicious data to victims in order to perturb their perception results, leading to hard brakes or increased collision risks. Our attacks demonstrate a high success rate of over 86% on high-fidelity simulated scenarios and are realizable in real-world experiments. To mitigate the vulnerability, we present a systematic anomaly detection approach that enables benign vehicles to jointly reveal malicious fabrication.

Through a cross-country (6,200km+) driving trip, we conduct in-depth measurements to study the current 5G mobility management practices adopted by three major US carriers. Using this rich dataset, we carry out a systematic analysis to uncover the handover mechanisms employed by 5G carriers, and compare them along several dimensions such as (4G vs. 5G) radio technologies, radio (low-, mid- \u0026 high-)bands, and deployment (SA vs NSA) modes.

To reduce the total cost of ownership, cloud database providers put in drastic effort to automatically optimize the resource utilization by tuning these knobs. There are two challenges. First, the tuning system should always abide by the service level agreement (SLA) while optimizing the resource utilization, which imposes strict constrains on the tuning process. Second, the tuning time should be reasonably acceptable since time-consuming tuning is not practical for production and online troubleshooting. In this paper, we design ResTune to automatically optimize the resource utilization without violating SLA constraints on the throughput and latency requirements. ResTune leverages the tuning experience from the history tasks and transfers the accumulated knowledge to accelerate the tuning process of the new tasks. The prior knowledge is represented from historical tuning tasks through an ensemble model. The model learns the similarity between the historical workloads and the target, which significantly reduces the tuning time by a meta-learning based approach. ResTune can efficiently handle different workloads and various hardware environments. We perform evaluations using benchmarks and real world workloads on different types of resources. The results show that, compared with the manually tuned configurations, ResTune reduces 65%, 87%, 39% of CPU utilization, I/O and memory on average, respectively.

His works often traverse the boundaries between reality and fantasy, creating a distinctive literary voice that resonates with a sense of mystique and introspection. \"夜晚的潜水艇 (Submarine of the Night)\" is Chen Chuncheng's debut short story collection, a testament to his literary prowess and imaginative depth. This collection comprises nine stories that wander between the old landscapes of mountains and rivers and the unknown expanses of the universe. Chen's writing, marked by its exquisite and buoyant imagination, skillfully opens secret passageways between reality and the realm of dreams. The stories in \"Submarine of the Night\" are an eclectic mix of narratives. a young boy roaming the sea depths, ancient steles lost in deep forests, phrases diffusing into everything, cloud pruning stations, the art of sword-making and wine brewing, a saxophone under the iron curtain, and a concert hall inside a blue whale. These tales weave themes of hiding and seeking, pursuit and escape, capturing the transient certainties found between the scorching sun and the deep abyss.","tags":["book"],"title":"夜晚的潜水艇(Submarine of the Night)","type":"misc"},{"authors":["Yongji Wu","Defu Lian","Shuowei Jin","Enhong Chen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1565488613,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565488613,"objectID":"96da591c472c078728479f2aa2e8e6b6","permalink":"https://shuoweijin.com/publication/ijcai19/","publishdate":"2019-08-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ijcai19/","section":"publication","summary":"Inferring social relations from user trajectory data is of great value in real-world applications such as friend recommendation and ride-sharing. Most existing methods predict relationship based on a pairwise approach using some hand-crafted features or rely on a simple skip-gram based model to learn embeddings on graphs. Using hand-crafted features often fails to capture the complex dynamics in human social relations, while the graph embedding based methods only use random walks to propagate information and cannot incorporate external semantic data provided. We propose a novel model that utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to learn user embeddings on the User Mobility Heterogeneous Graph in an unsupervised manner. This model is capable of propagating relation layer-wisely as well as combining both the rich structural information in the heterogeneous graph and predictive node features provided. Our method can also be extended to a semi-supervised setting if a part of the social network is available. The evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates that our method outperforms the state-ofthe-art approaches.","tags":["GNN","Machine Learning"],"title":"Graph Convolutional Networks on User Mobility Heterogeneous Graphs for Social Relationship Inference","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.
