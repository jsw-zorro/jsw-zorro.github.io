CAVs' driving decisions rely on remote untrusted data, making them susceptible to attacks carried out by malicious participants in the collaborative perception system. However, security analysis and countermeasures for such threats are absent. To understand the impact of the vulnerability, we break the ground by proposing various real-time data fabrication attacks in which the attacker delivers crafted malicious data to victims in order to perturb their perception results, leading to hard brakes or increased collision risks. Our attacks demonstrate a high success rate of over 86% on high-fidelity simulated scenarios and are realizable in real-world experiments. To mitigate the vulnerability, we present a systematic anomaly detection approach that enables benign vehicles to jointly reveal malicious fabrication. It detects 91.5% of attacks with a false positive rate of 3% in simulated scenarios and significantly mitigates attack impacts in real-world scenarios.","tags":["Autonomous Vehicle"],"title":"On Data Fabrication in Collaborative Vehicular Perception: Attacks and Countermeasures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xumiao Zhang","Shuowei Jin","Yi He","Ahmad Hassan","Z.

In this study, to understand QUIC's performance over high-speed networks and its potential to replace the TCP stack, we carry out a series of experiments to compare the UDP+QUIC+HTTP/3 (QUIC) stack and the TCP+TLS+HTTP/2 (HTTP/2) stack.

Measurement studies have shown that frequent handovers cause wild fluctuations in 5G throughput, and worst, service outages. Through a cross-country (6,200km+) driving trip, we conduct in-depth measurements to study the current 5G mobility management practices adopted by three major US carriers. Using this rich dataset, we carry out a systematic analysis to uncover the handover mechanisms employed by 5G carriers, and compare them along several dimensions such as (4G vs. 5G) radio technologies, radio (low-, mid- \u0026 high-)bands, and deployment (SA vs NSA) modes. We further quantify the impact of mobility on application performance, power consumption, and signaling overheads. We identify key challenges facing today’s NSA 5G deployments which result in unnecessary handovers and reduced coverage. Finally, we design a holistic handover prediction system Prognos and demonstrate its ability to improve QoE for two 5G applications 16K panoramic VoD and real-time volumetric video streaming.

Her life is filled with mundane challenges, including a strained relationship with her rebellious daughter Joy (played by Stephanie Hsu) and caring for her elderly father (played by James Hong). The plot takes a fantastical turn when Evelyn is suddenly thrust into an extraordinary adventure, where she learns that multiple universes exist, and she can access the skills and memories of her alternate selves.

To reduce the total cost of ownership, cloud database providers put in drastic effort to automatically optimize the resource utilization by tuning these knobs. There are two challenges. First, the tuning system should always abide by the service level agreement (SLA) while optimizing the resource utilization, which imposes strict constrains on the tuning process. Second, the tuning time should be reasonably acceptable since time-consuming tuning is not practical for production and online troubleshooting. In this paper, we design ResTune to automatically optimize the resource utilization without violating SLA constraints on the throughput and latency requirements. ResTune leverages the tuning experience from the history tasks and transfers the accumulated knowledge to accelerate the tuning process of the new tasks. The prior knowledge is represented from historical tuning tasks through an ensemble model. The model learns the similarity between the historical workloads and the target, which significantly reduces the tuning time by a meta-learning based approach. ResTune can efficiently handle different workloads and various hardware environments. We perform evaluations using benchmarks and real world workloads on different types of resources. The results show that, compared with the manually tuned configurations, ResTune reduces 65%, 87%, 39% of CPU utilization, I/O and memory on average, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, ResTune finds better configurations with up to ~18x speedups.","tags":["Database Systems","Machine Learning System"],"title":"ResTune: Resource Oriented Tuning Boosted by Meta-Learning for Cloud Databases","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arvind Narayanan","Xumiao Zhang","Ruiyang Zhu","Ahmad Hassan","Shuowei Jin","Xiao Zhu","Denis Rybkin","Dustin Zhang","Michael Yang","Z.

However, Odokawa's routine life takes a turn when he gets involved in a missing person case. The series unfolds as a complex narrative, intertwining the lives of various characters who ride in Odokawa's taxi, each with their own stories and secrets. What sets \"Odd Taxi\" apart is its distinctive approach to storytelling.

His works often traverse the boundaries between reality and fantasy, creating a distinctive literary voice that resonates with a sense of mystique and introspection. \"夜晚的潜水艇 (Submarine of the Night)\" is Chen Chuncheng's debut short story collection, a testament to his literary prowess and imaginative depth. This collection comprises nine stories that wander between the old landscapes of mountains and rivers and the unknown expanses of the universe. Chen's writing, marked by its exquisite and buoyant imagination, skillfully opens secret passageways between reality and the realm of dreams. The stories in \"Submarine of the Night\" are an eclectic mix of narratives. a young boy roaming the sea depths, ancient steles lost in deep forests, phrases diffusing into everything, cloud pruning stations, the art of sword-making and wine brewing, a saxophone under the iron curtain, and a concert hall inside a blue whale.

Most existing methods predict relationship based on a pairwise approach using some hand-crafted features or rely on a simple skip-gram based model to learn embeddings on graphs. Using hand-crafted features often fails to capture the complex dynamics in human social relations, while the graph embedding based methods only use random walks to propagate information and cannot incorporate external semantic data provided. We propose a novel model that utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to learn user embeddings on the User Mobility Heterogeneous Graph in an unsupervised manner. This model is capable of propagating relation layer-wisely as well as combining both the rich structural information in the heterogeneous graph and predictive node features provided. Our method can also be extended to a semi-supervised setting if a part of the social network is available. The evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates that our method outperforms the state-ofthe-art approaches.","tags":["GNN","Machine Learning"],"title":"Graph Convolutional Networks on User Mobility Heterogeneous Graphs for Social Relationship Inference","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Ayn Rand, a Russian-American writer and philosopher, gained widespread recognition and acclaim through her novels and philosophical writings, which advocate for rational individualism and laissez-faire capitalism. \"The Fountainhead,\" published in 1943, is one of Rand's most famous works. The novel centers around Howard Roark, an innovative and uncompromising young architect who refuses to conform to traditional architectural norms and societal expectations. Roark's character and his struggles represent Rand's ideal of the independent and creative individual who prioritizes personal vision and integrity over social conformity. The novel is set against the backdrop of the architecture industry, where Roark's modernist approach clashes with the prevailing styles. His battle against the establishment and his determination to pursue his artistic vision at all costs form the core of the story. The other characters in the novel, including Peter Keating, Ellsworth Toohey, and Dominique Francon, each represent different aspects of society and ideologies that contrast with Roark's Objectivist philosophy.","tags":["book"],"title":"Fountainhead","type":"misc"}]
